***Income tax calculator***
The purpose of this program is to calculate federal and state tax for a given annual income, marital status and current jurisdiction and provide a view of the userâ€™s net income under different tax jurisdictions in the US using graphs and charts 

***Identifying a need***
The tax structure in the US is very complex and varies from sate to state. When an individual is considering a job offer, the tax is significant consideration and might have a greater impact on the individual net earnings. This program provides a calculation of the individual current tax burden and overview of the taxes the individual will in different state. 
I believe that in the current environment where working remotely became essential and probably is the new reality, individuals will consider to move to different states to avoid heavily populated places and decrease costs of living. Tax savings is a significant consideration. Therefore, I believe that the tool I developed will provide insights to users on the tax impact related to their potential relocation as well as a user friendly tool to calculate total taxes in their current location
